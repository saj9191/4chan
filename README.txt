Project : quick+chan

Our project is an attempt to redesign the famous image-board site, 4chan, for the modern web. Although attempts have been made to remedy the quality
of the 4chan experience in recent years, the usability of the site is still extremely limited. We addressed the following concerns : 

1) Images that are clicked on open a new browser tab 
2) For a given thread that the user opens, there is no way to 'save', or 'remember' this thread, without keeping a tab of the thread alive.
3) Swapping/moving across boards is difficult and tedious

We addressed the previous concerns by

1) Adding a light-box functionality, done purely in CSS/jQuery that allows an image to be expanded to its full width and height in browser.
2) Adding a 'recent threads' list to the side-bar, where a user can see a saved thread.
3) Adding a 'recent boards' list to the side-bar where a user can see recently visited boards. 

The combination of these features allows users to save their browsing history session by session. For example, if a thread was particularly
interesting, the user does not have to refresh the main page of the board that he was browsing in order to find the thread again - he can simply open
it up from the sidebar. 

TLDR : We wanted to redesign 4chan - the api was interesting to use - up next, a 4chan cross reddit remix!

Cheers,
the quick+chan project
